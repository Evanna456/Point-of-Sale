## Author's Notes 

The first desktop application I made years ago. I only knew Java at that time but went straight to creating a fully pledge thick-client application using C#, SQlite and WPF framework. Basically I learn C# and XAML on the go while working on it and the result was an app that is riddled with bad code, patterns and design.

I am planning to rewrite this application in the foreseeable future that's why I'm bringing it back.

## WPF

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a UI framework for building Windows desktop applications. WPF supports a broad set of application development features, including an application model, resources, controls, graphics, layout, data binding and documents. WPF uses the Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) to provide a declarative model for application programming.
